GDevelop is a **full-featured, no-code, open-source** game development software. You can build **2D, 3D and multiplayer games** for mobile (iOS, Android), desktop and the web. GDevelop is fast and easy to use: the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system and reusable behaviors.

### 🚀 Discover more extensions on the [GDevelop Community List](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-community-list).

The [GDevelop Community List](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-community-list) is where extensions built by the whole GDevelop community can be found. Check it out!

## ⚙️ Submit your extension to the list of experimental extensions

If you've created an extension with GDevelop, you can submit it to be shared with the rest of the community. This [Trello board has the extensions that are being worked on](https://trello.com/b/AftjL2v1/gdevelop-extensions) by the community. Read the documentation about [functions](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/events/functions), [custom behaviors](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/behaviors/events-based-behaviors) and [custom objects](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/objects/custom-objects-prefab-template/) to build an extension for GDevelop.

If your extension is battle-tested, you can follow the review process in this repository:

> First, make sure it's already in the **[GDevelop Community List](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-community-list)**. Any extension can be added here and this will give it visibility in the GDevelop ecosystem.

1. Make sure the **descriptions**, **tags**, **names** are properly filled in the options of your extension.
2. **Export** your extension to a _.json file_ from GDevelop.
3. Submit it. You can either:
   - **Easy**: [submit it here](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop-extensions/issues/new/choose), attaching the _.json file_ (as a zip, because GitHub won't accept json files directly).
   - **If you know how to use git**: fork this repository, clone the git, add your .json file in `extensions/community` folder. Finally [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop-extensions/compare).
4. A member of the _GDevelop Extensions Team_ will then review it and give you feedback on what to do to have it accepted.
5. When it's ready, it will be merged and the extension now accessible in the "reviewed" extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> When your extension gets reviewed, the extension team will ask you to adapt your extension to reach a fairly high quality bar. This is normal! The feedback is here to help get the extension in a state where it's super flexible and useful for all users.
